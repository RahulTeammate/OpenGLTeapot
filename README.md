**Instructions:**  
1. Put the "teapot" directory in a Linux machine.  
2. Run "make" in a terminal within the "teapot" directory.  
3. Then run "./mp3" next. It will open a window of a rotating teapot in the perspective view.  
4. Press 'p' to render the teapot in wireframe. Press 'p' again to undo this.  
5. Press 'n' to render the teapot with its normals. Press 'n' again to undo this.  
6. Exit out of the window to end the program.  
7. Run "make clean" to delete all application files.  
8. If there are technical difficulties in running the program, then view this [link](https://youtu.be/RqzqAFnFax8) to see the teapot in action.  

**Additional Info:**  
1. LodePNG is credited towards its creators; I did not make it. I only used LodePNG to load the texture and environment maps.  
2. The Teapot OBJ was used to render the teapot seen on-screen.
